      <title>Android goes semantic</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The massive spread of mobile computing in our daily lives has attracted a huge community of mobile apps developers. These developers can take advantage of the benefits of semantic technologies (such as knowledge sharing and reusing, knowledge decoupling, etc.) to enhance their applications. Moreover, the use of semantic reasoners would enable them to create more intelligent applications capable of inferring logical consequences from the knowledge considered. However, using semantic APIs and reasoners on current Android-based devices is not problem-free and, currently, there are no remarkable efforts to enable mobile devices with semantic reasoning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our work, we analyze whether the most popular current available DL reasoners can be used on Android-based devices. We evaluate the efforts needed to port them to the Android platform, taking into account its limitations, and present some tests to show the performance of these reasoners on current smartphones/tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia infoboxes summarize the most important information of a Wikipedia page. In addition to being useful for Wikipedia readers, knowledge bases like DBpedia and Google Knowledge Graph can easily process and use their semi-structured content. However, the current mechanisms for creating or extending infoboxes are difficult and complex for editors to use. The result is fewer Wikipedia pages with infoboxes and more errors, inaccuracies, and deficiencies in existing infoboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present an approach to help users create rich and accurate Wikipedia infoboxes. Our system uses statistical and semantic knowledge from linked data sources to simplify the process of creating and extending infobox content. It constructs semantic infobox templates by suggesting common attributes and their values from similar articles and controlling the expected values semantically. We present the implemented prototype and experiments with users that evaluate both the quality of the new infobox content and the users&#39; subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SemIoTic is a middleware framework for IoT smart spaces that provides application developers and end-users with a semantic domain-relevant view of a smart space
while hiding the complexity of having to deal with/understand lower-level information generated by sensors and actuators. SemIoTic uses a metamodel based on the popular
SOSA/SSN ontology with some extensions to represent relationships between the low-level IoT devices&#39; world (i.e., devices, observations) and semantic concepts
(i.e., observable attributes of users and spaces). It supports a language where users can express their action requirements (i.e., requests for sensor data, commands
for actuators, and privacy preferences) in terms of user-friendly high-level concepts. We present an ontology-based algorithmic approach to translate user-defined actions
into sensor/actuators commands. Finally, our end-to-end approach includes a cross-layer solution to provide interoperability with diverse IoT devices and their data exchange protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several instances of SemIoTic have been deployed and used in IoT spaces. At the Donald Bren Hall building of UC Irvine, building occupants
have access to Concierge and Building Analytics smart applications and building administrators have access to a Contact Tracing Application to help combat the spread of COVID-19.
Also, SemIoTic has been deployed inside a navy ship from the Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC)
in the context of the Trident Warrior exercise 2019/2020. SemIoTic enabled testing of applications such as occupancy analysis in multiple
regions of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;useful-links-and-references&#34;&gt;Useful links and references&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SemIoTic is developed as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tippers.ics.uci.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TIPPERS&lt;/a&gt; (Testbed for IoT-based Privacy-Preserving PERvasive Spaces) DARPA research project.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays people are exposed to huge amounts of information that are generated continuously; the ever-increasing use of mobile devices and their pervasiveness enable users to receive and create new contents almost anywhere. Currently, Location-Based Services (LBSs) are very popular, as they offer users customized information taking into account their current location. However, whereas users have access to a wide variety of information, current mobile apps, Web pages, and LBSs are designed for specific scenarios and goals. So, the information about the context they manage is not explicitly represented but embedded in their code. Moreover, developing services ad hoc for specific purposes leads to the fact that there exist thousands of them (even with the same purpose), and therefore it is difficult to choose the most suitable one. Therefore, currently it is a challenge to provide a common framework that allows to manage knowledge obtained from data sent by heterogeneous moving objects (textual data, multimedia data, sensor data, etc.). In addition, the challenge is even greater considering situations where the system must adapt itself to contexts where the knowledge changes dynamically and in which moving objects can use different underlying wireless technologies and positioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose the system SHERLOCK, which offers a common framework with new functionalities for LBSs. As its namesake, the well-known Arthur Conan Doyle&amp;rsquo;s character, SHERLOCK uses abductive and deductive reasoning to infer information to answer user information requests (e.g., by providing interesting LBSs). Our system searches and shares up-to-date knowledge from nearby devices to relieve the user from knowing and managing such knowledge directly. Besides, the system guides the user in the process of selecting the service that best fits his/her needs in the given context. Finally, SHERLOCK processes user requests continuously to provide up-to-date answers in heterogeneous and dynamic contexts. Ontology reasoning and alignment methods are used to represent and manage, in a distributed way, the knowledge that describes moving and static objects (e.g., persons, vehicles, etc.) and interesting areas in a scenario. Moreover, the system uses mobile agent technology to carry the processing tasks wherever necessary in the dynamic underlying networks at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIPPERS is an IoT data management middleware that manages IoT smart spaces by collecting sensor data, inferring semantically meaningful information from it, and offering such inferences to developers to create smart applications. Sensor data collection, processing, and sharing leads to potential violations of people’s privacy given the sensitivity of the data and the inferences that can be extracted from it. TIPPERS integrates different Privacy Enhancing Technologies (e.g., policy-based access control, differential privacy, secure computing, etc.) to deal with privacy issues in IoT data management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIPPERS has been deployed in several IoT smart spaces. The main deployment is at the UC Irvine campus where it handles IoT data from more than 20 buildings. Based on such data (including connectivity logs from WiFi APs, HVAC data, video footage, etc.) TIPPERS generates inferences such as location of people and occupancy of spaces. We have developed several smart applications which use those inferences to offer personalized services to the campus inhabitants. In particular, we have recently developed COVID-19 regulation monitoring tools to assess the adherence of the community to occupancy regulations. TIPPERS has also been successfully deployed in two US Navy ships as part of the Trident Warrior 2019 and 2020 excersice.&lt;/p&gt;
