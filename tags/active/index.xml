      <description>&lt;p&gt;SmartSPEC is a smart space simulator and data generator that creates customizable smart space datasets using semantic models of spaces, people, events and sensors. We employ ML-based approaches to characterize and learn attributes of the embedded people and events in a sensorized space and apply an event-driven simulation strategy to generate realistic simulated data about the space (events, trajectories, sensor datasets, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SmartSPEC architecture consists of two main components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario Learning, which uses input seed connectivity data and a priori knowledge of the underlying space and sensors to learn high-order concepts of events, people and trajectories, which we refer to as &amp;ldquo;metaevents&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;metapeople&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;metatrajectories&amp;rdquo;, respectively; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario Generation, which takes SmartSPEC data to generate a synthetic dataset from which a smart space dataset (e.g., trajectory dataset, sensor observation dataset, etc.) can be derived. We use the variations of the data models described below to define various scenarios, which drives the generation of new observable phenomena in the smart space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SemIoTic is a middleware framework for IoT smart spaces that provides application developers and end-users with a semantic domain-relevant view of a smart space 
while hiding the complexity of having to deal with/understand lower-level information generated by sensors and actuators. SemIoTic uses a metamodel based on the popular 
SOSA/SSN ontology with some extensions to represent relationships between the low-level IoT devices&#39; world (i.e., devices, observations) and semantic concepts 
(i.e., observable attributes of users and spaces). It supports a language where users can express their action requirements (i.e., requests for sensor data, commands 
for actuators, and privacy preferences) in terms of user-friendly high-level concepts. We present an ontology-based algorithmic approach to translate user-defined actions 
into sensor/actuators commands. Finally, our end-to-end approach includes a cross-layer solution to provide interoperability with diverse IoT devices and their data exchange protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several instances of SemIoTic have been deployed and used in IoT spaces. At the Donald Bren Hall building of UC Irvine, building occupants 
have access to Concierge and Building Analytics smart applications and building administrators have access to a Contact Tracing Application to help combat the spread of COVID-19.
Also, SemIoTic has been deployed inside a navy ship from the Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) 
in the context of the Trident Warrior exercise 2019/2020. SemIoTic enabled testing of applications such as occupancy analysis in multiple 
regions of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;SemIoTic is developed as part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tippers.ics.uci.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TIPPERS&lt;/a&gt; (Testbed for IoT-based Privacy-Preserving PERvasive Spaces) DARPA research project.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIPPERS is an IoT data management middleware that manages IoT smart spaces by collecting sensor data, inferring semantically meaningful information from it, and offering such inferences to developers to create smart applications. Sensor data collection, processing, and sharing leads to potential violations of people’s privacy given the sensitivity of the data and the inferences that can be extracted from it. TIPPERS integrates different Privacy Enhancing Technologies (e.g., policy-based access control, differential privacy, secure computing, etc.) to deal with privacy issues in IoT data management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIPPERS has been deployed in several IoT smart spaces. The main deployment is at the UC Irvine campus where it handles IoT data from more than 20 buildings. Based on such data (including connectivity logs from WiFi APs, HVAC data, video footage, etc.) TIPPERS generates inferences such as location of people and occupancy of spaces. We have developed several smart applications which use those inferences to offer personalized services to the campus inhabitants. In particular, we have recently developed COVID-19 regulation monitoring tools to assess the adherence of the community to occupancy regulations. TIPPERS has also been successfully deployed in two US Navy ships as part of the Trident Warrior 2019 and 2020 excersice.&lt;/p&gt;
