Course Description In this course, we will learn about computer networks and the Internet in particular. We will present the architecture and design principles. Today\u0026rsquo;s computer networks are organized in layers, each with well-defined functionality and interface with other layers. We will discuss protocols used at the application (Ch.2), transport (Ch.3), network (Ch.4,5), link and MAC (Ch.6) layers; wireless and mobile networks (Ch.7).

For example, eyewear technology, such as Google Glass, is opening a new world of possibilities. One of the best capabilities of such devices is that they allow spontaneous and effortless photo taking. Instead of pulling out your camera, turning it on, aiming, taking a picture and putting it away, Google Glass makes it as easy as saying “Okay Glass, take a picture”. However, their strength has also become controversial: people worry that their pictures could be taken without their knowledge or consent, violating their privacy. These privacy concerns are not new and have existed since camera technology became accessible to everyone. But, Google Glass makes it difficult to know when someone is taking a picture of you. Resorting to drastic measures, like banning their use in public places, is not a good solution.\nWe present FaceBlock, which protects the privacy rights of individuals by allowing them to choose whether or not to be included in pictures taken with Glass. Our approach allows a user’s mobile device to share privacy policies with nearby Glass devices using a P2P communication channel (our prototype uses Bluetooth). Along with the policy, users share information that helps identify them in a picture. When the Google Glass takes a picture the system recognizes faces on it, checks policies it has received, and obscures faces as necessary.\nUseful links and references  FaceBlock in the news:  Nature: What could derail the wearables revolution?

So, the TD needs to manage a great amount of continuously changing information to quickly select the camera whose view should be broadcasted. Besides, the better the decisions made by the TD, the more interesting the content for the audience. Therefore, the development of systems that could help the TD with the selection of camera views is demanded by broadcasting organizations.\nIn this project, we present the system MultiCAMBA that helps TDs in the live broadcasting task by allowing them to indicate in run-time their interest in certain kind of shots, and the system will show the cameras that are able to provide them. To achieve this task, the system manages location-dependent queries generated according to the interests of the TD. Moreover, to avoid the use of costly on line real-image processing techniques over the camera views, such real camera views are recreated in a 3D engine by using the information contained in a 3D model of the scenario. This model is updated continuously with real-time data retrieved from the real objects and cameras in the scenario. In this way, the system extracts high-level semantic features of 2D projections of the 3D reconstruction of the camera views.\nUseful links and references ","date":1566518400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566518400,"objectID":"95fec74859eed969a131cc014cb0f213","permalink":"/project/multicamba/","publishdate":"2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/multicamba/","section":"project","summary":"Multi-CAMera Broadcasting Assistant","tags":null,"title":"MultiCAMBA","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"SemIoTic is a middleware framework for IoT smart spaces that provides application developers and end-users with a semantic domain-relevant view of a smart space while hiding the complexity of having to deal with/understand lower-level information generated by sensors and actuators.

Currently, Location-Based Services (LBSs) are very popular, as they offer users customized information taking into account their current location. However, whereas users have access to a wide variety of information, current mobile apps, Web pages, and LBSs are designed for specific scenarios and goals. So, the information about the context they manage is not explicitly represented but embedded in their code. Moreover, developing services ad hoc for specific purposes leads to the fact that there exist thousands of them (even with the same purpose), and therefore it is difficult to choose the most suitable one. Therefore, currently it is a challenge to provide a common framework that allows to manage knowledge obtained from data sent by heterogeneous moving objects (textual data, multimedia data, sensor data, etc.). In addition, the challenge is even greater considering situations where the system must adapt itself to contexts where the knowledge changes dynamically and in which moving objects can use different underlying wireless technologies and positioning systems.\nWe propose the system SHERLOCK, which offers a common framework with new functionalities for LBSs. As its namesake, the well-known Arthur Conan Doyle\u0026rsquo;s character, SHERLOCK uses abductive and deductive reasoning to infer information to answer user information requests (e.g., by providing interesting LBSs). Our system searches and shares up-to-date knowledge from nearby devices to relieve the user from knowing and managing such knowledge directly. Besides, the system guides the user in the process of selecting the service that best fits his/her needs in the given context. Finally, SHERLOCK processes user requests continuously to provide up-to-date answers in heterogeneous and dynamic contexts. Ontology reasoning and alignment methods are used to represent and manage, in a distributed way, the knowledge that describes moving and static objects (e.g., persons, vehicles, etc.) and interesting areas in a scenario. Moreover, the system uses mobile agent technology to carry the processing tasks wherever necessary in the dynamic underlying networks at any time.\nUseful links and references ","date":1566518400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566518400,"objectID":"74baca487124a8ef0835d00e0854f43e","permalink":"/project/sherlock/","publishdate":"2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sherlock/","section":"project","summary":"System for Heterogeneous mobilE Requests by Leveraging Ontological and Contextual Knowledge","tags":null,"title":"SHERLOCK","type":"project"},{"authors":["Roberto Yus"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1459555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459555200,"objectID":"28cd2e31e5521e1163c6e087df06e17d","permalink":"/publication/thesis-2016/","publishdate":"2016-04-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The context of the work presented in this thesis is mobile computing and knowledge management. We focus on the usage of semantic technologies for representation, sharing, and integration of knowledge about services (specially Location-Based Services) as well as agents to discover devices which can provide interesting information for users. Therefore, our main contribution is a general and flexible agent-based architecture based on the use of semantic technologies to provide services to mobile users. Location-Based Services (LBS) provide added value by customizing the information offered to mobile users based on their locations. Current LBS are usually designed for specific scenarios and goals with predefined schemas for the modeling of the elements involved in their scenarios. Apart from specific LBS, some approaches of architectures to provide users with LBS have been presented before. However, these approaches assume either a centralized architecture or its distribution using a fixed infrastructure. In addition, these approaches usually act as mere repositories of services and do not deal with their execution to obtain the information that the user needs. Our proposal is the system SHERLOCK (System for Heterogeneous mobilE Requests by Leveraging Ontological and Contextual Knowledge) that offers a general and flexible architecture to provide users with LBS which might be interesting regarding their context. SHERLOCK is based on semantic and agent technologies: 1) ontologies are used to model the information about users, devices, services, and the world around a device whereas a semantic reasoner is used to manage these ontologies and infer non-explicit knowledge; and 2) an agent-oriented architecture enables SHERLOCK devices to autonomously exchange knowledge keeping their local ontologies updated, and to process user information requests, finding what the user needs wherever it is. The use of these two technologies helps SHERLOCK to be flexible in terms of both the services it offers to the user (which are learned from the interaction between devices), and the mechanisms to find the information that the user wants (which adapt to the underlying communication infrastructure).","tags":["Mobile Computing","Semantic Web","Location-Based Services"],"title":"Semantic Management of Location-Based Services in Wireless Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Yus","Eduardo Mena","Sergio Ilarri","Arantza Illarramendi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1414886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1414886400,"objectID":"241da1fd36af7495546f850286302217","permalink":"/publication/ercim-2014/","publishdate":"2014-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ercim-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Citizens can access a variety of computing services to get information, but it is often difficult to know which service will offer the best information.
