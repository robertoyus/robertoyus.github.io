Programming assignments and projects will provide experience in a number of languages.\nPrerequisites: You must have completed CMSC 202 and CMSC 203 with a grade of C or better.\nLearning Objectives  Understand how programming languages have and continue to evolve Learn about formal definition and specification of programming languages Learn about different paradigms, and gain some experience in several Study how programming languages are implemented Experience new ideas that are appearing in programming languages  BlackBoard BlackBoard will be the primary channel for disseminating information and course materials. BlackBoard will be used to post student lab grades and to support course discussion forums. If you have difficulty accessing the CMSC 331 Blackboard site, e-mail your instructor.\nDiscussion forums will be created for general questions about course material, and for general questions about programming and tools. A discussion forum will also be created for each project in this course. You can, and should, post questions on the discussion forum to be answered by your fellow students and/or TA and professor. General questions (i.e., anything that another student may also be wondering about) should be posted here, rather than sent to the professor and TA. Responses posted by students to questions on BlackBoard must follow the academic integrity guidelines outlined below, so it is okay to post about questions about the assignment, resources you are using, clarifications to the question, and general approaches—just do not post code (either in questions or answers).\n","date":1635120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1635120000,"objectID":"4da5c0b471cfb59c33fb4e64812df539","permalink":"/courses/cmsc331/","publishdate":"2021-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/cmsc331/","section":"courses","summary":"UMBC, CSEE deparment.","tags":null,"title":"CMSC 331 Programming Languages - Fall 2021","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lecture MoWe 4:00-5:15p\nInstructor Roberto Yus [ryus at umbc dot edu]\n Office: ITE 342 Office Hours: TBD by appointment.

You are responsible for all material covered in class, even if not found in the on-line class presentation materials. If you should happen to miss a class, you are responsible for getting any missed notes or announcements from a classmate. You are required to prepare for each class by having read all of the assigned materials beforehand.\nClass participation Education works better when we are all actively engaged in it. It is more effective and more interesting when there are questions, comments, challenges, and occasional rants. These can take place in class but also on line via the BlackBoard discussion forum for the class. I welcome your feedback throughout the semester about how the course is going. In addition to regular office hours, you can schedule an appointment with me if you think one-on-one time would help.\nPrivacy Electronic communications do not always guarantee privacy. Sharing personal information is voluntary, not required.\nClass Expectation During COVID-19 The University is committed to protecting the health and safety of the entire community \u0026ndash; students, faculty, and staff. For this reason, it is currently mandatory that everyone wear a mask in University buildings, including classrooms. Please read the following carefully and, if you have any questions, ask.\n You should be fully masked during any in-person interactions, including lectures, and office hours. You must wear a mask appropriately (i.e., over nose and mouth) and you must do this for every class session and for the entire duration of each class session. If you fail to do this, you will be politely reminded of the requirement and then asked to leave if you do not comply. If you are sick, stay home. If you are sick for two or more lectures, get in touch and we will work out how to accommodate any changes to the schedule. This class will be held primarily in person. If you need to attend remotely for some time for health reasons, get in touch so we can work out the details. However, note that this is a synchronous class (no recordings). Participation is a critical element of this class, but you will never be penalized for prioritizing your and others' health. Just stay in touch and we will work out the details.  For resources during COVID 19 you can refer to the UMBC\u0026rsquo;s COVID-19 website\nUMBC Policies Academic Integrity \u0026amp; Conduct Students are expected to adhere to all university policies regarding student conduct, academic and otherwise, as posted on the University web site and in the Student Handbook. Academic dishonesty of any kind will be handled in accordance with University policy.\n\u0026ldquo;By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC\u0026rsquo;s scholarly community, in which everyone\u0026rsquo;s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal. To read the full Student Academic Conduct Policy, consult the UMBC Student Handbook, the Faculty Handbook, or the UMBC Policies section of the UMBC Directory.\u0026rdquo;\nStatement adopted by UMBC\u0026rsquo;s Undergraduate Council and Provost\u0026rsquo;s Office.\nIf you think you may have accidentally broken a rule, come and talk to us about it. You will be much better off than if we discover it ourselves. Students who violate this academic integrity policy will at least receive a grade of 0 for that assignment, but might face a harsher penalty depending on how egregious the violation was. A second violation will also result in a reduction of one full letter grade in the student\u0026rsquo;s final course grade.\nIn the case where one student copies the program of another student, both students are considered to have violated this policy. Here, copying includes not just programs that are verbatim copies, but also programs that are substantially similar and could not have been produced independently. Furthermore, all parties concerned will have their prior homework and programs checked. Violations of this policy may be reported to the University\u0026rsquo;s Academic Conduct Committee for further action. Egregious cases of cheating will be written up as a \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;more serious\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; infraction. In this case, you will not be allowed to drop the course. Also, a \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;more serious\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; infraction would appear as a permanent part of your student record and would be seen by potential employers when they ask for an official copy of your transcript.\nAccessibility and Disability Accommodations, Guidance and Resources Support services for students with disabilities are provided for all students qualified under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA \u0026amp; ADAAA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act who request and are eligible for accommodations. The Office of StudentDisability Services (SDS) is the UMBC department designated to coordinate accommodations that would create equal access for students when barriers to participation exist in University courses, programs, or activities.\nIf you have a documented disability and need to request academic accommodations in your courses, please refer to the SDS website at sds.umbc.edu for registration information and office procedures.\nSDS email: disAbility@umbc.edu\nSDS phone: (410) 455-2459\nIf you will be using SDS approved accommodations in this class, please contact me (instructor) to discuss implementation of the accommodations. During remote instruction requirements due to COVID, communication and flexibility will be essential for success.\nSexual Assault, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Based Violence and Discrimination UMBC Policy and Federal law (Title IX) prohibit discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in University programs and activities. Any student who is impacted by sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual exploitation, gender discrimination, pregnancy discrimination, gender-based harassment or retaliation should contact the University’s Title IX Coordinator to make a report and/or access support and resources:\nMikhel A. Kushner, Title IX Coordinator (she/they)\n410-455-1250 (direct line), kushner@umbc.edu\nYou can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action.You will not be forced to file a formal complaint or police report. Please be aware that the University may take action on its own if essential to protect the safety of the community.If you are interested in or thinking about making a report, please use theOnline Reporting/Referral Form. Please note that, if you report anonymously,the University’s ability to respond will be limited.\nNotice that Faculty are Responsible Employees with Mandatory Reporting Obligations:\nAll faculty members are consideredResponsible Employees, per UMBC’s Policy on Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Discrimination. Faculty are therefore required to report any/ all available information regarding conduct falling under the Policy and violations of the Policy to the Title IX Coordinator, even if a student discloses an experience that occurred before attending UMBC and/or an incident that only involves people not affiliated with UMBC.Reports are required regardless of the amount of detail provided and even in instances where support has already been offered or received.\nWhile faculty members want encourage you to share information related to your life experiences through discussion and written work, students should understand that faculty are required to reportpast and presentsexual assault, domestic and interpersonal violence, stalking, and gender discrimination that isshared with them to the Title IX Coordinator so that the University can inform students of their rights, resources and support. While you are encouraged to do so, you are not obligated to respond to outreach conducted as a result of a report to the Title IX Coordinator.\nIf you need to speak with someone in confidence, who does not have an obligation to report to the Title IX Coordinator, UMBC has a number of Confidential Resources available to support you:\n The Counseling Center (Main Campus): 410-455-2472 / After-Hours 410-455-3230 [Monday–Friday; 8:30 a.m.–5 p.m.] Center for Counseling and Consultation (Shady Grove Campus): 301-738-6273 (Messages checked hourly) Online Appointment Request Form University Health Services: 410-455-2542 [Monday–Friday 8:30 a.m.–5 p.m.] Pastoral Counseling via Interfaith Center: 410-455-3657; interfaith@umbc.edu [7 days a week; Fall and Spring 7 a.m.–11 p.m.; Summer and Winter 8 a.m.–8 p.m.]  Other Resources:\n Women’s Center (for students of all genders): 410-455-2714; womenscenter@umbc.edu .

WiFi connectivity data consists of sporadic connections between devices and nearby WiFi access points (APs), each of which may cover a relatively large area within a building. Our system, entitled semantic LOCATion cleanER (LOCATER), postulates semantic localization as a series of data cleaning tasks - frst, it treats the problem of determining the AP to which a device is connected between any two of its connection events as a missing value detection and repair problem. It then associates the device with the semantic subregion (e.g., a conference room in the region) by postulating it as a location disambiguation problem. LOCATER uses a bootstrapping semi-supervised learning method for coarse localization and a probabilistic method to achieve fner localization. The paper shows that LOCATER can achieve signifcantly high accuracy at both the coarse and fne levels.","tags":["Data Management","Internet of Things"],"title":"LOCATER: Cleaning WiFi Connectivity Datasets for Semantic Localization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael August","Christopher Davison","Mamadou H.

We present Sieve, a layered approach of implementing FGAC in existing DBMSs, that exploits a variety of their features (e.g., UDFs, index usage hints, query explain) to scale to a large number of policies. Given a query, Sieve exploits its context to filter the policies that need to be checked. It also generates guarded expressions that save on evaluation cost by grouping policies and exploit database indices to cut on read cost. Our experimental results demonstrate that existing DBMSs can utilize Sieve to significantly reduce query-time policy evaluation cost. Using Sieve DBMSs can support real-time access control in applications such as emerging smart environments.","tags":["Data Management","Privacy"],"title":"Sieve: A Middleware Approach to Scalable Access Control for Database Management Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peeyush Gupta","Michael J.

These services use the user location to customize the offered information. However, most of those services are designed for specific scenarios and goals with implicit knowledge about the application context. As a consequence, hundreds of them are available (even with the same purpose). So, it is difficult for users to choose the most suitable service as they are in charge of knowing/finding the services which will be interesting for them, and handle the information that such services need. In this paper, we present an approach to handle LBS for mobile users which relieves them from knowing and managing the knowledge related to such services. This approach consists of a proposal for the modeling of such information as ontologies, which are handled by an agent-based architecture. Also, we propose to maintain updated the knowledge each mobile device contains by leveraging the exchange of information with others. For accessing the local knowledge, we present an SPARQL-like query language which avoids the ambiguities of natural language. Finally, we propose an approach to translate the user information needs into formal requests expressed in this query language, which could be later processed against the knowledge repositories to obtain the results the user needs.","tags":["Mobile Computing","Data Management","Semantic Web","Location-Based Services"],"title":"A Knowledge-Based Approach to Enhance Provision of Location-Based Services in Wireless Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Yus","Georgios Bouloukakis","Sharad Mehrotra","Nalini Venkatasubramanian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572652800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572652800,"objectID":"fc5c5edb139591dc719f4384da689220","permalink":"/publication/buildsys-2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/buildsys-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes a middleware framework for IoT smart spaces, SemIoTic, that provides application developers and end-users with the semantic domain-relevant view of the smart space, hiding the complexity of having to deal with/understand lower-level information generated by sensors and actuators.

However, their strength has also become controversial: people worry that their pictures could be taken without their knowledge or consent, violating their privacy. These privacy concerns are not new and have existed since camera technology became accessible to everyone. But, Google Glass makes it difficult to know when someone is taking a picture of you. Resorting to drastic measures, like banning their use in public places, is not a good solution.\nWe present FaceBlock, which protects the privacy rights of individuals by allowing them to choose whether or not to be included in pictures taken with Glass.

To achieve this task, the system manages location-dependent queries generated according to the interests of the TD.

Currently, Location-Based Services (LBSs) are very popular, as they offer users customized information taking into account their current location. However, whereas users have access to a wide variety of information, current mobile apps, Web pages, and LBSs are designed for specific scenarios and goals. So, the information about the context they manage is not explicitly represented but embedded in their code. Moreover, developing services ad hoc for specific purposes leads to the fact that there exist thousands of them (even with the same purpose), and therefore it is difficult to choose the most suitable one. Therefore, currently it is a challenge to provide a common framework that allows to manage knowledge obtained from data sent by heterogeneous moving objects (textual data, multimedia data, sensor data, etc.). In addition, the challenge is even greater considering situations where the system must adapt itself to contexts where the knowledge changes dynamically and in which moving objects can use different underlying wireless technologies and positioning systems.\nWe propose the system SHERLOCK, which offers a common framework with new functionalities for LBSs. As its namesake, the well-known Arthur Conan Doyle\u0026rsquo;s character, SHERLOCK uses abductive and deductive reasoning to infer information to answer user information requests (e.g., by providing interesting LBSs). Our system searches and shares up-to-date knowledge from nearby devices to relieve the user from knowing and managing such knowledge directly. Besides, the system guides the user in the process of selecting the service that best fits his/her needs in the given context. Finally, SHERLOCK processes user requests continuously to provide up-to-date answers in heterogeneous and dynamic contexts. Ontology reasoning and alignment methods are used to represent and manage, in a distributed way, the knowledge that describes moving and static objects (e.g., persons, vehicles, etc.) and interesting areas in a scenario.

However, these approaches assume either a centralized architecture or its distribution using a fixed infrastructure. In addition, these approaches usually act as mere repositories of services and do not deal with their execution to obtain the information that the user needs. Our proposal is the system SHERLOCK (System for Heterogeneous mobilE Requests by Leveraging Ontological and Contextual Knowledge) that offers a general and flexible architecture to provide users with LBS which might be interesting regarding their context. SHERLOCK is based on semantic and agent technologies: 1) ontologies are used to model the information about users, devices, services, and the world around a device whereas a semantic reasoner is used to manage these ontologies and infer non-explicit knowledge; and 2) an agent-oriented architecture enables SHERLOCK devices to autonomously exchange knowledge keeping their local ontologies updated, and to process user information requests, finding what the user needs wherever it is. The use of these two technologies helps SHERLOCK to be flexible in terms of both the services it offers to the user (which are learned from the interaction between devices), and the mechanisms to find the information that the user wants (which adapt to the underlying communication infrastructure).","tags":["Mobile Computing","Semantic Web","Location-Based Services"],"title":"Semantic Management of Location-Based Services in Wireless Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Yus","Eduardo Mena"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"f101f3509278c90c1677a8491130dc42","permalink":"/publication/momm-2015/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/momm-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Mobile devices have penetrated our daily lives and currently smartphones and tablets are everywhere.

So, the TD needs to manage a great amount of continuously changing information to quickly select the camera whose view should be broadcasted. Besides, the better the decisions made by the TD, the more interesting the content for the audience. Therefore, the development of systems that could help the TD with the selection of camera views is demanded by broadcasting organizations.\nIn this paper, we present the system MultiCAMBA that helps TDs in the live broadcasting task by allowing them to indicate in run-time their interest in certain kind of shots, and the system will show the cameras that are able to provide them. To achieve this task, the system manages location-dependent queries generated according to the interests of the TD. Moreover, to avoid the use of costly on line real-image processing techniques over the camera views, such real camera views are recreated in a 3D engine by using the information contained in a 3D model of the scenario. This model is updated continuously with real-time data retrieved from the real objects and cameras in the scenario. In this way, the system extracts high-level semantic features of 2D projections of the 3D reconstruction of the camera views. We present a prototype of the system and experimental results that show the feasibility of our proposal.","tags":["Multimedia","Data Management"],"title":"MultiCAMBA: A System for Selecting Camera Views in Live Broadcasting of Sport Events Using a Dynamic 3D Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Yus","Fernando Bobillo","Carlos Bobed","Eduardo Mena"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1433116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433116800,"objectID":"68e0bde9a7a7d8b2ff21ba9b2dff6504","permalink":"/publication/ore-2015/","publishdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ore-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"The advantage of using semantic reasoners based on Description Logics (DL) for the development of intelligent systems is doubtless: They make easy the optimal management of knowledge (expressed as ontologies).

So, TDs require a mechanism to easily and precisely represent the kind of shot they want to obtain abstracting them from the need to be aware of all the views provided by the cameras.\nIn this paper we present our proposal to help a TD to visually define, using an interface for the definition of 3D scenes, an interesting sample view of one or more objects in the scenario. We recreate the views of the cameras in a 3D engine and apply 3D geometric computations on their virtual view, instead of analyzing the real images they provide, to enable an efficient and precise realtime selection.

These developers can take advantage of the benefits of semantic technologies (such as knowledge sharing and reusing, knowledge decoupling, etc.) to enhance their applications. Moreover, the use of semantic reasoners would enable them to create more intelligent applications capable of inferring logical consequences from the knowledge considered. However, using semantic APIs and reasoners on current Android-based devices is not problem-free and, currently, there are no remarkable efforts to enable mobile devices with semantic reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we analyze whether the most popular current available DL reasoners can be used on Android-based devices. We evaluate the efforts needed to port them to the Android platform, taking into account its limitations, and present some tests to show the performance of these reasoners on current smartphones/tablets.","tags":["Mobile Computing","Semantic Web"],"title":"Android goes Semantic: DL Reasoners on Smartphones","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Yus","Eduardo Mena","Sergio Ilarri","Arantza Illarramendi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"a72bce8aa79d4a7ed73f39cac9e3d831","permalink":"/publication/frdinmovement-2013/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frdinmovement-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Mobile Computing","Semantic Web","Location-Based Services"],"title":"Semantic Management of Moving Objects with SHERLOCK","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sergio Ilarri","Eduardo Mena","Arantza Illarramendi","Roberto Yus","Maider Laka","Gorka Marcos"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"578d69178cce21abfff8b5b412c084ae","permalink":"/publication/mis-2012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mis-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"The production costs of broadcasting sport events that require tracking moving objects are continuously increasing. Although those events are very demanded by the audience, broadcasting organizations have economical difficulties to afford them. For that reason, they are demanding the development of new professional (software and hardware) equipments that lead to a considerable reduction of the production costs. In this paper, we present a software system that takes into account these needs. This system allows a technical director to indicate his/her interest about certain moving objects or geographic areas in run-time. The system is in charge of selecting the cameras that can provide the types of views requested on those interesting objects and areas. So, it decreases the human effort needed to produce (create, edit and distribute) audiovisual contents, giving at the same time the opportunity to increase their quality. For this, the system provides a friendly interface to specify requirements and obtain which monitoring video cameras attached to moving or static objects fulfill them, along with a query processor to handle those requests in a continuous and efficient way. We illustrate the feasibility of our system in a specific scenario using real data of a traditional rowing race in the Basque Country.","tags":["Multimedia","Data Management"],"title":"A Friendly Location-Aware System to Facilitate the Work of Technical Directors When Broadcasting Sport Events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sergio Ilarri","Roberto Yus","Eduardo Mena","Arantza Illarramendi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"4291d15ce0a7eca70556e269ca3caae0","permalink":"/publication/frdinmovement-2012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frdinmovement-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Mobile Computing","Semantic Web","Location-Based Services"],"title":"Semantic-Based Query Processing on Moving Objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Yus","David Anton","Eduardo Mena","Sergio Ilarri","Arantza Illarramendi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1322697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1322697600,"objectID":"e35246bf0dd27ab43e2fea17b7938de8","permalink":"/publication/mobiquitous-2011/","publishdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mobiquitous-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"In this demo paper we present MultiCAMBA (Multi-CAMera Broadcasting Assistant), a context– and location–aware system that, using a 3D model updated continuously with real-time data retrieved from the scenario, helps technical directors (TDs) in the live broadcasting task.
