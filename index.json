We present Sieve, a layered approach of implementing FGAC in existing DBMSs, that exploits a variety of their features (e.g., UDFs, index usage hints, query explain) to scale to a large number of policies. Given a query, Sieve exploits its context to filter the policies that need to be checked. It also generates guarded expressions that save on evaluation cost by grouping policies and exploit database indices to cut on read cost. Our experimental results demonstrate that existing DBMSs can utilize Sieve to significantly reduce query-time policy evaluation cost.

These services use the user location to customize the offered information. However, most of those services are designed for specific scenarios and goals with implicit knowledge about the application context. As a consequence, hundreds of them are available (even with the same purpose). So, it is difficult for users to choose the most suitable service as they are in charge of knowing/finding the services which will be interesting for them, and handle the information that such services need. In this paper, we present an approach to handle LBS for mobile users which relieves them from knowing and managing the knowledge related to such services. This approach consists of a proposal for the modeling of such information as ontologies, which are handled by an agent-based architecture. Also, we propose to maintain updated the knowledge each mobile device contains by leveraging the exchange of information with others. For accessing the local knowledge, we present an SPARQL-like query language which avoids the ambiguities of natural language. Finally, we propose an approach to translate the user information needs into formal requests expressed in this query language, which could be later processed against the knowledge repositories to obtain the results the user needs.","tags":["Mobile Computing","Data Management","Semantic Web","Location-Based Services"],"title":"A Knowledge-Based Approach to Enhance Provision of Location-Based Services in Wireless Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Yus","Georgios Bouloukakis","Sharad Mehrotra","Nalini Venkatasubramanian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572652800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572652800,"objectID":"fc5c5edb139591dc719f4384da689220","permalink":"/publication/buildsys-2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/buildsys-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes a middleware framework for IoT smart spaces, SemIoTic, that provides application developers and end-users with the semantic domain-relevant view of the smart space, hiding the complexity of having to deal with/understand lower-level information generated by sensors and actuators.

One of the best capabilities of such devices is that they allow spontaneous and effortless photo taking. Instead of pulling out your camera, turning it on, aiming, taking a picture and putting it away, Google Glass makes it as easy as saying “Okay Glass, take a picture”. However, their strength has also become controversial: people worry that their pictures could be taken without their knowledge or consent, violating their privacy. These privacy concerns are not new and have existed since camera technology became accessible to everyone. But, Google Glass makes it difficult to know when someone is taking a picture of you. Resorting to drastic measures, like banning their use in public places, is not a good solution.\nWe present FaceBlock, which protects the privacy rights of individuals by allowing them to choose whether or not to be included in pictures taken with Glass. Our approach allows a user’s mobile device to share privacy policies with nearby Glass devices using a P2P communication channel (our prototype uses Bluetooth).

So, the TD needs to manage a great amount of continuously changing information to quickly select the camera whose view should be broadcasted. Besides, the better the decisions made by the TD, the more interesting the content for the audience. Therefore, the development of systems that could help the TD with the selection of camera views is demanded by broadcasting organizations.\nIn this project, we present the system MultiCAMBA that helps TDs in the live broadcasting task by allowing them to indicate in run-time their interest in certain kind of shots, and the system will show the cameras that are able to provide them. To achieve this task, the system manages location-dependent queries generated according to the interests of the TD. Moreover, to avoid the use of costly on line real-image processing techniques over the camera views, such real camera views are recreated in a 3D engine by using the information contained in a 3D model of the scenario. This model is updated continuously with real-time data retrieved from the real objects and cameras in the scenario. In this way, the system extracts high-level semantic features of 2D projections of the 3D reconstruction of the camera views.\nUseful links and references ","date":1566518400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566518400,"objectID":"95fec74859eed969a131cc014cb0f213","permalink":"/project/multicamba/","publishdate":"2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/multicamba/","section":"project","summary":"Multi-CAMera Broadcasting Assistant","tags":null,"title":"MultiCAMBA","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"SemIoTic is a middleware framework for IoT smart spaces that provides application developers and end-users with a semantic domain-relevant view of a smart space while hiding the complexity of having to deal with/understand lower-level information generated by sensors and actuators.

Currently, Location-Based Services (LBSs) are very popular, as they offer users customized information taking into account their current location. However, whereas users have access to a wide variety of information, current mobile apps, Web pages, and LBSs are designed for specific scenarios and goals. So, the information about the context they manage is not explicitly represented but embedded in their code. Moreover, developing services ad hoc for specific purposes leads to the fact that there exist thousands of them (even with the same purpose), and therefore it is difficult to choose the most suitable one. Therefore, currently it is a challenge to provide a common framework that allows to manage knowledge obtained from data sent by heterogeneous moving objects (textual data, multimedia data, sensor data, etc.). In addition, the challenge is even greater considering situations where the system must adapt itself to contexts where the knowledge changes dynamically and in which moving objects can use different underlying wireless technologies and positioning systems.\nWe propose the system SHERLOCK, which offers a common framework with new functionalities for LBSs. As its namesake, the well-known Arthur Conan Doyle\u0026rsquo;s character, SHERLOCK uses abductive and deductive reasoning to infer information to answer user information requests (e.g., by providing interesting LBSs). Our system searches and shares up-to-date knowledge from nearby devices to relieve the user from knowing and managing such knowledge directly. Besides, the system guides the user in the process of selecting the service that best fits his/her needs in the given context. Finally, SHERLOCK processes user requests continuously to provide up-to-date answers in heterogeneous and dynamic contexts. Ontology reasoning and alignment methods are used to represent and manage, in a distributed way, the knowledge that describes moving and static objects (e.g., persons, vehicles, etc.) and interesting areas in a scenario.

The main deployment is at the UC Irvine campus where it handles IoT data from more than 20 buildings.

We have developed several smart applications which use those inferences to offer personalized services to the campus inhabitants.

The underlying assumption is that users trust IoT systems in honoring their policies. However, this trust assumption is incorrectly positioned since IoT systems may not be honest or may fall victim to cyberattacks. We address such concerns by providing mechanisms to help in ensuring trust and accountability at the time of translating a contract (agreed and signed policies). The objective of the proposed scheme is two fold, (1) translation of contracts from a high-level to device-level, (2) attestation of the translation. We have implemented the proposed scheme for contract translation and attestation of translation as a module and integrated it with the TIPPERS system (our IoT testbed under development).

We focus on the usage of semantic technologies for representation, sharing, and integration of knowledge about services (specially Location-Based Services) as well as agents to discover devices which can provide interesting information for users. Therefore, our main contribution is a general and flexible agent-based architecture based on the use of semantic technologies to provide services to mobile users. Location-Based Services (LBS) provide added value by customizing the information offered to mobile users based on their locations. Current LBS are usually designed for specific scenarios and goals with predefined schemas for the modeling of the elements involved in their scenarios. Apart from specific LBS, some approaches of architectures to provide users with LBS have been presented before. However, these approaches assume either a centralized architecture or its distribution using a fixed infrastructure. In addition, these approaches usually act as mere repositories of services and do not deal with their execution to obtain the information that the user needs. Our proposal is the system SHERLOCK (System for Heterogeneous mobilE Requests by Leveraging Ontological and Contextual Knowledge) that offers a general and flexible architecture to provide users with LBS which might be interesting regarding their context. SHERLOCK is based on semantic and agent technologies: 1) ontologies are used to model the information about users, devices, services, and the world around a device whereas a semantic reasoner is used to manage these ontologies and infer non-explicit knowledge; and 2) an agent-oriented architecture enables SHERLOCK devices to autonomously exchange knowledge keeping their local ontologies updated, and to process user information requests, finding what the user needs wherever it is. The use of these two technologies helps SHERLOCK to be flexible in terms of both the services it offers to the user (which are learned from the interaction between devices), and the mechanisms to find the information that the user wants (which adapt to the underlying communication infrastructure).","tags":["Mobile Computing","Semantic Web","Location-Based Services"],"title":"Semantic Management of Location-Based Services in Wireless Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Yus","Eduardo Mena"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"f101f3509278c90c1677a8491130dc42","permalink":"/publication/momm-2015/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/momm-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Mobile devices have penetrated our daily lives and currently smartphones and tablets are everywhere.

So, the TD needs to manage a great amount of continuously changing information to quickly select the camera whose view should be broadcasted. Besides, the better the decisions made by the TD, the more interesting the content for the audience. Therefore, the development of systems that could help the TD with the selection of camera views is demanded by broadcasting organizations.\nIn this paper, we present the system MultiCAMBA that helps TDs in the live broadcasting task by allowing them to indicate in run-time their interest in certain kind of shots, and the system will show the cameras that are able to provide them. To achieve this task, the system manages location-dependent queries generated according to the interests of the TD. Moreover, to avoid the use of costly on line real-image processing techniques over the camera views, such real camera views are recreated in a 3D engine by using the information contained in a 3D model of the scenario. This model is updated continuously with real-time data retrieved from the real objects and cameras in the scenario. In this way, the system extracts high-level semantic features of 2D projections of the 3D reconstruction of the camera views.

So, different applications are being developed for tracking, navigation, advertising, etc., but most of those applications are designed for specific scenarios and goals with implicit knowledge about the application context. However, currently it is a challenge to provide a common framework that allows to manage knowledge obtained from data sent by heterogeneous moving objects (textual data, multimedia data, sensor data, etc.). Moreover, the challenge is even greater considering situations where the system must adapt itself to contexts where the knowledge changes dynamically and in which moving objects can use different underlying wireless technologies and positioning systems.\nIn this paper we present the system SHERLOCK, that offers a common framework with new functionalities for LBSs. Our system processes user requests continuously to provide up-to-date answers in heterogeneous and dynamic contexts. Ontologies and semantic techniques are used to share knowledge among devices, which enables the system to guide the user selecting the service that best fits his/her needs in the given context. Moreover, the system uses mobile agent technology to carry the processing tasks wherever necessary in the dynamic underlying networks at any time.

Rafiki can infer possible diseases and treatments by representing the diseases, their symptoms, and patient context in OWL ontologies and by reasoning over this model. The use of semantic representation of data makes it easier to share knowledge related to disease, symptom, diagnosis guidelines, and patient demography, between various personnel involved in health-care (e.g., CHWs, patients, healthcare providers).

This system allows a technical director to indicate his/her interest about certain moving objects or geographic areas in run-time. The system is in charge of selecting the cameras that can provide the types of views requested on those interesting objects and areas. So, it decreases the human effort needed to produce (create, edit and distribute) audiovisual contents, giving at the same time the opportunity to increase their quality. For this, the system provides a friendly interface to specify requirements and obtain which monitoring video cameras attached to moving or static objects fulfill them, along with a query processor to handle those requests in a continuous and efficient way.
